# superhero

This project is a full-stack application for managing superheroes. It consists of a backend API built with Express.js and a frontend application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to add new superheroes, view a list of superheroes, and sort them by their humility score.

### Features

Add New Hero: Users can add new superheroes by providing their name, superpower, and humility score.
View Hero List: Users can view a list of all superheroes, sorted by their humility score in descending order.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

### If I had more time

* Edit Hero Details: Allow users to edit the details of existing superheroes.
* Delete Hero: Provide functionality to delete a superhero from the list.
* Search and Filter: Add search and filter capabilities to easily find superheroes based on their name or superpower.
* Authentication: Add user authentication to secure the application and allow only authorized users to manage superheroes.
* Hero Details Page: Create a detailed view page for each superhero with more information and a larger avatar.
* Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Vercel (for frontend) and Heroku (for backend) for easy access and scalability.
* Use AI to generate an avatar based on the hero's superpower

#### To collaborate effectively with a teammate on implementing the suggested useful features, we can follow these steps:

* Schedule a meeting to discuss the features and prioritize them.
* Create a project board (e.g., GitHub Projects, Trello) to track tasks and progress.
* Create a new branch for each feature or task following a consistent branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, pull requests).
* Conduct code reviews for each pull request to ensure code quality and consistency.
* Document any architectural or design decisions made during implementation.
